### Relativistic Velocity Addition Law
Here we derive the law by the example of a race between a ball and a photon in a moving train. Suppose the location they meet devide the train carriage into two sections of $1 - f : f$ ratio.

In the train frame, set after time $T$, the ball and the photon meet again, and set the length of the carriage to $L$, the speed of the ball to $u$, then we can get:
$$
uT = (1 - f)L, \quad cT = (1 + f)L \\~\\
\Rightarrow \frac{u}{c} = \frac{1 - f}{1 + f} \\~\\
\Rightarrow f = \frac{c - u}{c + u}
$$

In the track frame, set after time $T_0$, the photon reaches the right end of the carriage, and set the distance between the ball and the photon at this time to $D$, the speed of the ball to $w$, the speed of the train to $v$, then:
$$
D = cT_0 - wT_0 \\
L = cT_0 - vT_0
$$ Set after time $T_1$, the ball and the photon meet again, then:
$$
D = cT_1 + wT_1 \\
fL = cT_1 + vT_1
$$ So:
$$
\frac{D}{L} = \frac{c - w}{c - v} \\~\\
\frac{D}{fL} = \frac{c + w}{c + v} \\~\\
\Rightarrow f = \frac{c - w}{c + w}\cdot \frac{c + v}{c - v} \\~\\
\Rightarrow \frac{c - u}{c + u} = \frac{c - w}{c + w}\cdot \frac{c + v}{c - v} \\~\\
\Rightarrow \frac{c - w}{c + w} = \frac{c - u}{c + u}\cdot \frac{c - v}{c + v} \\~\\
\Rightarrow w = \frac{u + v}{1 + \left( \dfrac{u}{c} \right)\left( \dfrac{v}{c} \right)}
$$
