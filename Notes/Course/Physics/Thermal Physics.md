## Thermal Physics
### Basic Concepts
#### The Laws of Thermodynamics
**The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics**: If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they must be in thermal equilibrium with each other.

**The Third Law of Thermodynamics**: It is impossible for any procedure to lead to the isotherm $T= 0$ in a finite number of steps.

<br>

#### Temperature Scales
Absolute temperature (Kelvin) scale: $\displaystyle T = T_{\text{triple}} \frac{p}{p_{\text{triple}}} \approx \frac{273.16}{610} p $
$273.16$ is the difference between absolute zero and the temperature of the triple point of water .

Celsius scale: $T_C = T - 273.15$

Fahrenheit scale: $\displaystyle T_F = \frac{9}{5}T_C + 32^{\circ}F$

<br>

#### Thermal Expansion
Linear expansion: $\Delta L = \alpha L_0 \Delta T$
Volume expansion: $\Delta V = \beta V_0 \Delta T$
$$
L^3 = [L_0(1 + \alpha \Delta T)]^3 = L_0^3(1 + 3\alpha \Delta T + O(\Delta T)^2) \\~\\
V = V_0(1 + \beta \Delta T) \\~\\
\Rightarrow \beta = 3\alpha 
$$

<br>

#### Ideal Gases
Equation of state for an ideal gas:
$$
PV = nRT \\~\\
PV = \frac{N}{N_A}RT = Nk_BT
$$

where $R = 8.315 \text{ J/mol}\cdot\text{K}$, $\displaystyle k_B = \frac{R}{N_A} = 1.38\times 10^{-23} \text{ J/K}$.

Therefore $$\ln V = \ln T + \ln(nR / P)$$

Then we can get 
$$
\beta = \left( \frac{1}{V} \frac{dV}{dT} \right)_p 
= \left( \frac{d(\ln V)}{dT} \right)_p 
= \frac{d(\ln T)}{dT} = \frac{1}{T}
$$

<br>

#### Real Gases
The van der Waals equation of state is
$$
(P + \frac{an^2}{V^2})(V - nb) = nRT
$$

$a$ is about the attractive forces between the gas molecules.
$b$ is about the volume of gas molecule.









<br>

### Microscopic Model of Ideal Gases
#### Pressure on the Wall
The total momentum generated by molecules colliding with wall during $dt$ is
$$dP_x = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{N}{V} \cdot Av_xdt \cdot 2mv_x = \frac{NAmv_x^2}{V} dt$$

So the pressure on the wall is 
$$p = \frac{1}{A}\frac{dP_x}{dt} = \frac{Nmx_v^2}{V} = \rho mv_x^2$$

Therefore, we can get
$$
\overline{v^2} = \overline{v_x^2} + \overline{v_y^2} + \overline{v_z^2} \\~\\
p = \frac{1}{3} \rho m\overline{v^2}
$$

Furthermore, we can get
$$
pV = Nm \overline{v_x^2} = Nk_BT
\\~\\
\overline{\frac{1}{2} mv_x^2} = \overline{\frac{1}{2} mv_y^2} = \overline{\frac{1}{2} mv_z^2} = \frac{1}{2} k_BT
$$

So for ideal gas, temperature is a measure of internal energy. It measures the average energy per degree of freedom per molecule/atom.

<br>

#### Heat Capacity
**Equipartition Theorem**
The energy of each molecule is
$$E = \sum_i \frac{p_i^2}{2m} + \sum_i \frac{1}{2}I_i\omega_i^2 + \sum_i \frac{1}{2}k_iq_i^2 + \cdots$$

The mean value of each independent quadratic term in the energy is equal to $k_BT/2$. So the average energy of each molecule is
$$f\cdot \frac{k_BT}{2}$$

where $f$ is the degrees of freedom of the molecule. Vibration has both kinetic energy and potential energy, so it should be counted twice.

Internal energy: $\displaystyle U = \frac{f}{2} Nk_BT = \frac{f}{2} nRT$

Heat capacity: $\displaystyle c_V = \left( \frac{\Delta U}{\Delta T} \right)_V = \frac{f}{2}Nk_B$

Molar specific heat: $\displaystyle C_V = \frac{c_V}{n} = \frac{f}{2}R$

**Mode Counting**
- $N$-atom linear molecule
  - Translation: $3$
  - Rotation: $2$
  - Vibration: $3N - 5$
- $N$-atom nonlinear molecule
  - Translation: $3$
  - Rotation: $3$
  - Vibration: $3N - 6$

For single atom, it only has three degrees of freedom.
For solid, Each atom vibrates around its equilibrium position and has three degrees of freedom, so $f=6$.

<br>

#### Maxwell Distribution
Define the distribution function $f(v)$ as $$f(v) = \frac{1}{N} \frac{dN}{dv}$$

Then we have
$$
dN = Nf(v)dv \\~\\
\int f(v)dv = 1
$$

The Maxwell distribution function is
$$
f(v) = 4\pi \left( \frac{m}{2\pi k_BT} \right)^{3/2} v^2 e^{-mv^2/2k_BT}
$$

#### Characteristic Speed
**Gaussâ€™s Probability Integral**
$$
I_{2n} = (-1)^n \frac{d^n}{da^n} I_0 \\~\\
I_{2n+1} = (-1)^n \frac{d^n}{da^n} I_1
$$

So we can get
$$
I_0 = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-ax^2} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}}, \quad
I_1 = \int_0^{\infty} xe^{-ax^2} = \frac{1}{2a} \\~\\
I_2 = \int_0^{\infty} x^2e^{-ax^2} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a^3}}, \quad
I_3 = \int_0^{\infty} x^3e^{-ax^2} = \frac{1}{2a^2} \\~\\
I_4 = \int_0^{\infty} x^4e^{-ax^2} = \frac{3}{8} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a^5}}, \quad
I_5 = \int_0^{\infty} x^5e^{-ax^2} = \frac{1}{a^3} \\~\\
$$

**Most Probable Speed**
$$
\frac{df(v)}{dv} = 0 \\~\\
\Rightarrow (2v - \frac{mv^3}{k_BT}) e^{-mv^2/2k_BT} = 0 \\~\\
\Rightarrow v_p = \sqrt{\frac{2k_BT}{m}}
$$

**Average Speed**
$$
\begin{aligned}
  \bar{v} &= \frac{1}{N} \int vdN = \int vf(v)dv \\
  &= \int_0^{\infty} 4\pi \left( \frac{m}{2\pi k_BT} \right)^{3/2} v^3 e^{-mv^2/2k_BT} \\
  &= \sqrt{\frac{8k_BT}{\pi m}}
\end{aligned}
$$

**Root Mean Sqaure Speed**
$$
\begin{aligned}
  v_{\text{rms}} &= \sqrt{\overline{v^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \int v^2dN} = \sqrt{\int v^2f(v)dv} \\
  &= \int_0^{\infty} 4\pi \left( \frac{m}{2\pi k_BT} \right)^{3/2} v^4 e^{-mv^2/2k_BT} \\
  &= \sqrt{\frac{3k_BT}{m}}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Heat and The 1st Law of Thermodynamics
#### Heat ,Latent Heat, and Specific Heat
**Definition of Heat**
Heat is defined as the transfer of energy across the boundary of a system due to a temperature difference between the system and its surroundings.

The ways of heat transfer are **conduction**, **convection**, and **radiation**.

Unit of heat includes $\mathrm{J}$ and $\mathrm{cal}$, where $1 \mathrm{cal} = 4.186\mathrm{J}$.

<br>

**Latent Heat**
Latent heat is energy released or absorbed during a constant-temperature process.

The latent heat of vaporization for a given substance is usually somewhat higher than the latent heat of fusion.

The specific latent heat is defined as $$L = \frac{Q}{m}$$

<br>

**Specific Heat**
Specific heat capacity is defined as $$c = \frac{1}{M} \cdot \frac{dQ}{dT}$$

Molar heat capacity is defined as $$C = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{dQ}{dT}$$

Molar heat capacity at constant volume is denoted by $C_V$.
Molar heat capacity at constant pressure is denoted by $C_p$.



<br>

#### Heat Conduction
Fourier heat conduction law:
$$\frac{Q}{\Delta t} = -\kappa_t A \frac{dT}{dx} $$

where $\lambda$ or $\kappa$ is coefficient of thermal conductivity.


<br>

#### Mean Free Path
Assume there is only one moving molecule. It will collide with the stationary molecules whose centers of mass are located within a cylinder of diameter $2d$.

So during time interval $t$, the average number of collisions is $$z = n_v\pi d^2vt$$

where $\displaystyle n_v = \frac{p}{k_B T}$ is the density of the molecules.

Therefore, the mean free path is 
$$
l = \frac{vt}{n_V\pi d^2vt} = \frac{1}{n_V\pi d^2} = \frac{k_BT}{\pi d^2p}
$$

Because all molecules are actually moving, we must consider their relative motion when counting the number of collisions. By 
$$
|\mathbf{v}_1 - \mathbf{v}_2|^2 = |\mathbf{v}_1|^2 + |\mathbf{v}_2|^2 - 2\mathbf{v}_1\cdot \mathbf{v}_2
$$

We can conclude that the average relative speed is $\sqrt{2}v$. Hence,
$$
l = \frac{vt}{n_V\pi d^2(\sqrt{2}v)t} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}n_V\pi d^2} = \frac{k_BT}{\sqrt{2}\pi d^2p}
$$

And the average molecular separation is $$d = \frac{1}{n_V^{1/3}}$$

<br>

#### The 1st Law of Thermodynamics
The change in the internal energy $U$ of the system can be expressed as:
$$\Delta U = Q - W$$

The work done by the gas is 
$$
dW = Fdy = PAdy = PdV 
\\~\\
W = \int_{V_i}^{V_f}PdV
$$

<br>

#### Thermodynamic Processes
A **quasi-static** process is one that is performed sufficiently slowly so that the system is always close to equilibrium.
A **reversible** process is one that can be run backward in time by simply reversing its inputs and outputs.

A reversible process must be quasi-static.
A quasi-static process is not necessarily reversible (e.g., energy dissipation)

<br>

#### Isothermal vs Free Expansion
In isothermal expansion,
$$
W = \int_{V_i}^{V_f} \frac{Nk_BT}{V} dV = Nk_BT \ln \frac{V_f}{V_i} \\~\\
Q = W
$$

In free expansion, 
$$
P= 0, W = 0
$$

<br>

#### Isobaric vs Isovolumetric Processes

In isovolumetric (isochoric) process
$$
W = 0 \\~\\
Q = nC_V\Delta T \\~\\
\Delta U = Q = nC_V\Delta T
$$

In isobaric process,
$$
W = P\Delta V \\~\\
Q = nC_P\Delta T \\~\\
\Delta U = Q - W = n(C_P - R)\Delta T
$$

So 
$$
C_P = C_V + R
\\~\\
C_V = \frac{f}{2}R 
\\~\\
C_P = \frac{f+2}{2}R
\\~\\
\gamma = \frac{C_P}{C_V} = \frac{f+2}{f}
$$

<br>

#### Adiabatic Equation
In adiabatic process, no heat transfer into or out of the system, that is, 
$$
Q = 0
\\~\\
\Delta U = -W
$$

So
$$
dU = nC_VdT = -PdV = -\frac{nRT}{V} dV \\~\\
\Rightarrow \frac{dT}{T} = -\frac{R}{C_V} \frac{dV}{V} \\~\\
\Rightarrow TV^{\gamma-1} = \text{const} \\~\\
\Rightarrow PV^{\gamma} = \text{const}
$$










<br>

### Engines and The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics
#### Otto Cycle
Otto cycle is a four-stroke cycle consisting of two upstrokes and two downstrokes. It represents the gasoline engine.
$$
W = Q_h - Q_c \\~\\
Q_h = nC_V(T_C - T_B) \\~\\
Q_c = nC_V(T_D - T_A) \\~\\
e = \frac{W}{Q_h} = 1 - \frac{Q_c}{Q_h} = 1 - \frac{T_D - T_A}{T_C - T_B}
$$

Because 
$$
\left( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \right)^{\gamma-1} = \frac{T_A}{T_B} = \frac{T_D}{T_C}
$$

We can get 
$$
e = 1 - \frac{T_A}{T_B} = 1 - \frac{T_D}{T_C} = 1 - \frac{1}{(V_1/V_2)^{\gamma-1}} = 1 - \frac{1}{r^{\gamma-1}}
$$

<br>

#### Diesel Engine
$$
Q_h = nC_p(T_C - T_B) \\~\\
Q_c = nC_V(T_D - T_A) \\~\\
W_{\text{cycle}} = n[C_p(T_C - T_B) - C_V(T_D - T_A)]
$$

<br>

#### Carnot Cycle
Carnot cycle provides an upper limit on the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic engine, which consists of four steps: isothermal expansion, adiabatic expansion, isothermal compression, adiabatic compression.

In isothermal processes,
$$
Q_h = W_{AB} = nRT_h \ln \frac{V_B}{V_A} \\~\\
Q_c = |W_{CD}| = nRT_c \ln \frac{V_C}{V_D} \\~\\
\Rightarrow \frac{Q_c}{Q_h} = \frac{T_c}{T_h} \frac{\ln(V_C/V_D)}{\ln(V_B/V_A)}
$$

In adiabatic processes,
$$
T_hV_B^{\gamma-1} = T_cV_C^{\gamma-1} \\~\\
T_hV_A^{\gamma-1} = T_cV_D^{\gamma-1} \\~\\
\Rightarrow \frac{Q_c}{Q_h} = \frac{T_c}{T_h}
$$

So the efficiency of Carnot engine is $$e_C = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h}$$

<br>

#### Heat Pumps
The coefficient of performance at heating mode is
$$\frac{Q_h}{W} = \frac{Q_h}{Q_h - Q_c} = \frac{1}{1 - \dfrac{Q_c}{Q_h}} = \frac{1}{1 - \dfrac{T_c}{T_h}} = \frac{T_h}{T_h - T_c}$$

The coefficient of performance at cooling modet is
$$\frac{Q_c}{W} = \frac{T_c}{T_h - T_c}$$

<br>

#### The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics
**Clausius Statement**
It is impossible to construct a cyclical machine whose sole effect is the continuous transfer of heatfrom one object to another object at a higher temperature without the input of energy by work.

**Kelvin Statement**
It is impossible to construct a heat engine that, operating in a cycle, produces no effect other than the absorption of heat from a reservoir and the performance of an equal amount of work.











<br>

### Entropy and Information
#### The Function of Entropy
In a Carnot cycle, $\displaystyle \frac{Q_c}{Q_h} = \frac{T_c}{T_h}$, now put in the proper signs, we can get
$$
\frac{Q_h}{T_h} + \frac{Q_c}{T_c} = 0
$$

Any reversible process can be approximated by a sum of Carnot cycles, hence 
$$
\oint_{\text{reversible } C} \frac{dQ}{T} = 0
$$

Therefore, we can define **entropy** as a state function.

The entropy of an ideal gas is
$$
dQ = dU + Pdv \\~\\
\Rightarrow TdS = dU + PdV \\~\\
\Rightarrow dS = \frac{nC_V^{mol}dT}{T} + \frac{RdV}{V} \\~\\
\Rightarrow S(T, V) = S_0 + nC_V^{mol}\ln \frac{T}{T_0} + R\ln \frac{V}{V_0}
$$

<br>

#### The Second Law in terms of Entropy
If the path is arbitrary,
$$
1 - \frac{Q_c}{Q_h} \le 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h} \\~\\
\Rightarrow \frac{Q_h}{T_h} + \frac{Q_c}{T_c} \le 0
$$

Then we can get
$$
\oint_C \frac{dQ}{T} = \oint_{C_1} \frac{dQ}{T} + \oint_{C_2} \frac{dQ}{T} = \oint_{C_1} \frac{dQ}{T} + S(1) - S(2) \le 0
\\~\\
\Rightarrow \oint_{C_1} \frac{dQ}{T} \le S(2) - S(1)
\\~\\
\Rightarrow dS \ge \frac{dQ}{T}
$$

So the change in entropy of an isolated system must be greater than zero for an irreversible process and equal to zero for a reversible process.

<br>

#### Entropy: A Measure of Disorder
Assume that each molecule occupies some microscopic volume $V_m$, and the number of molecules is $N$, then the number of microstates is
$$
W_i = \left( \frac{V_i}{V_m} \right)^N \\~\\
W_f = \left( \frac{V_f}{V_m} \right)^N \\~\\
\Rightarrow \frac{W_f}{W_i} = \left( \frac{V_f}{V_i} \right)^N
$$

Hence we can suggest
$$S = k_B \ln W$$

<br>

#### Shannon Entropy
Given a random variable $X \in \{ x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n \}$, and its probability $P_x$, we can define Shannon entropy as
$$
S = -\sum_x P_x\log_2 P_x
$$

Shannon entropy quantifies the average information/uncertainty of the random variable.
Shannon entropy also quantifies the resources needed to store the information.
