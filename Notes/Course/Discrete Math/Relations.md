## Relations
### 9.1 Relations and Their Properties
- Let A and B be sets. A **binary relation from $A$ to $B$** is a subset of $A × B$.
- We use the notation $aRb$ to denote that $(a, b) ∈ R$ and $a \cancel{R} b$ to denote that $(a, b) ∉ R$.
- Moreover, when $(a, b)$ belongs to $R$, $a$ is said to be **related to** $b$ by $R$.
- A **relation on a set $A$** is a relation from $A$ to $A$.
